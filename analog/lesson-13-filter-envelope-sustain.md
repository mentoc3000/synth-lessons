# Lesson 13: Filter Envelope Sustain

## Setting the Steady State

The filter envelope sustain controls the steady-state level of the filter while you hold down a key. This is the level the filter settles to after the attack and decay phases, and it remains at this level as long as you hold the key. Think of it as setting the "resting" brightness of your sound during the note's duration.

The sustain level works in conjunction with the envelope amount to determine the final filter position. A high sustain level with high envelope amount creates a bright, open sound, while a low sustain level creates a darker, more closed sound.

## Understanding Sustain Level

### Sustain Level Ranges

- **0% (Minimum)**: The filter closes to its minimum position
- **25%**: Low sustain, creates dark, mellow sounds
- **50%**: Moderate sustain, creates balanced sounds
- **75%**: High sustain, creates bright, open sounds
- **100% (Maximum)**: The filter opens to its maximum position

### Sustain Characteristics

- **Low Sustain**: Creates dark, mellow sounds with closed filter
- **Moderate Sustain**: Creates balanced sounds with moderate filter opening
- **High Sustain**: Creates bright, open sounds with open filter

## Musical Applications

### Dark Sounds

Low sustain levels (0-25%) create dark, mellow sounds that sit back in the mix. These are perfect for bass sounds, dark pads, and atmospheric sounds.

### Balanced Sounds

Moderate sustain levels (25-75%) create balanced sounds that work well in most musical contexts. These are great for lead sounds, pads, and general-purpose sounds.

### Bright Sounds

High sustain levels (75-100%) create bright, open sounds that cut through the mix. These are perfect for lead sounds, bright pads, and sounds that need to be heard clearly.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Sustain Level Exploration

1. Load Analog synthesizer with a sawtooth wave
2. Set the filter to low-pass with cutoff at 50%
3. Set the filter envelope amount to 50%
4. Set the attack to 100ms and decay to 200ms
5. Start with sustain at 0%
6. Slowly increase the sustain level while playing a middle C (C4)
7. Notice how the sound becomes brighter and more open

### Exercise 2: Sustain and Envelope Amount Interaction

1. Set the sustain to 50% (moderate)
2. Start with envelope amount at 25%
3. Slowly increase the envelope amount while playing a middle C (C4)
4. Notice how the sustain level affects the final filter position
5. Try different sustain levels with different envelope amounts

### Exercise 3: Musical Context Test

1. Create a simple chord progression (C-Am-F-G)
2. Try different sustain levels for each chord
3. Notice how different sustain levels affect the overall character
4. Try to find the sustain level that works best for your musical context

### Exercise 4: Filter Type Comparison

1. Set the sustain to 50% and envelope amount to 50%
2. Try each filter type (low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, notch)
3. Notice how the sustain level affects each filter type differently
4. Try different sustain levels with each filter type

## Listening Examples

### Low Sustain Sounds

**Song**: "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)" by Eurythmics

- **What to listen for**: The dark, mellow character of the bass line
- **Character**: Dark, mellow, with closed filter
- **Why it works**: Low sustain creates bass sounds that sit well in the mix

**Song**: "Blue Monday" by New Order

- **What to listen for**: The dark, analog character of the lead sounds
- **Character**: Dark, analog, with closed filter
- **Why it works**: Low sustain creates leads with a warm, musical character

### Moderate Sustain Sounds

**Song**: "Axel F" by Harold Faltermeyer

- **What to listen for**: The balanced character of the lead melody
- **Character**: Balanced, with moderate filter opening
- **Why it works**: Moderate sustain creates leads that are both musical and present

**Song**: "Chameleon" by Herbie Hancock

- **What to listen for**: The balanced character of the lead sounds
- **Character**: Balanced, with moderate filter opening
- **Why it works**: Moderate sustain creates leads that work well in jazz contexts

### High Sustain Sounds

**Song**: "Jump" by Van Halen

- **What to listen for**: The bright, open character of the lead synth
- **Character**: Bright, open, with open filter
- **Why it works**: High sustain creates leads that cut through the mix with authority

**Song**: "Strobe" by Deadmau5

- **What to listen for**: The bright, open character of the pad sounds
- **Character**: Bright, open, with open filter
- **Why it works**: High sustain creates pads that are both bright and atmospheric

## Advanced Sustain Techniques

### Sustain Shaping

Use different sustain levels to create different steady-state characteristics. Low sustain creates dark sounds, while high sustain creates bright sounds.

### Sustain Modulation

Use modulation to change the sustain level over time. This creates evolving, complex sounds.

### Sustain and Resonance Interaction

Combine sustain level with resonance to create emphasis effects and special sounds.

## Key Takeaways

- **Sustain controls steady state** - higher sustain creates brighter sounds, lower sustain creates darker sounds
- **Envelope amount affects the result** - higher amounts create more dramatic sustain effects
- **Context matters** - choose your sustain level based on the musical role and desired character
- **Filter type affects the result** - the same sustain level affects different filter types differently

The filter envelope sustain is your tool for controlling the steady-state character of your sound. Understanding how to use it effectively will help you create sounds that are both musical and appropriate for their context.
