# Lesson 19: LFO Rate

## Understanding Low Frequency Oscillators

The LFO (Low Frequency Oscillator) rate controls how fast the LFO cycles through its waveform. Unlike audio oscillators that produce audible frequencies, LFOs operate at much lower frequencies (typically 0.1 Hz to 20 Hz) and are used to modulate other parameters, creating movement and expression in your sounds.

The LFO rate is measured in Hertz (Hz) and determines the speed of the modulation. A slow LFO rate creates gentle, gradual changes, while a fast LFO rate creates rapid, dramatic changes. Think of it as controlling the "breathing" or "pulsing" speed of your sound.

## Understanding LFO Rate

### LFO Rate Ranges

- **0.1-1 Hz (Very Slow)**: Creates slow, atmospheric changes
- **1-5 Hz (Slow)**: Creates gentle, musical changes
- **5-10 Hz (Moderate)**: Creates noticeable, rhythmic changes
- **10-20 Hz (Fast)**: Creates rapid, dramatic changes
- **20+ Hz (Very Fast)**: Creates very rapid, almost tremolo-like changes

### Rate Characteristics

- **Slow Rate**: Creates gentle, atmospheric movement
- **Moderate Rate**: Creates musical, rhythmic movement
- **Fast Rate**: Creates dramatic, attention-grabbing movement

## Musical Applications

### Atmospheric Effects

Slow LFO rates (0.1-5 Hz) create gentle, atmospheric movement that adds interest without being distracting. These are perfect for pads, ambient sounds, and background elements.

### Rhythmic Effects

Moderate LFO rates (5-10 Hz) create rhythmic movement that can sync with the tempo of your music. These are great for lead sounds, bass sounds, and any sound that needs rhythmic interest.

### Dramatic Effects

Fast LFO rates (10+ Hz) create dramatic, attention-grabbing movement. These are perfect for special effects, lead sounds, and any sound that needs to stand out.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: LFO Rate Exploration

1. Load Analog synthesizer with a sawtooth wave
2. Set the filter to low-pass with cutoff at 50%
3. Enable the LFO and set it to modulate the filter cutoff
4. Start with LFO rate at 0.5 Hz (very slow)
5. Slowly increase the LFO rate while playing a middle C (C4)
6. Notice how the movement becomes faster and more dramatic

### Exercise 2: LFO Rate and Depth Interaction

1. Set the LFO rate to 2 Hz (slow)
2. Start with LFO depth at 25%
3. Slowly increase the LFO depth while playing a middle C (C4)
4. Notice how the LFO rate affects the overall movement
5. Try different LFO rates with different depths

### Exercise 3: Musical Context Test

1. Create a simple chord progression (C-Am-F-G)
2. Try different LFO rates for each chord
3. Notice how different LFO rates affect the overall character
4. Try to find the LFO rate that works best for your musical context

### Exercise 4: LFO Waveform Comparison

1. Set the LFO rate to 2 Hz
2. Try different LFO waveforms (sine, square, triangle, sawtooth)
3. Notice how the LFO rate affects each waveform differently
4. Try different LFO rates with each waveform

## Listening Examples

### Slow LFO Rate

**Song**: "Strobe" by Deadmau5

- **What to listen for**: The slow, atmospheric movement in the pad sounds
- **Character**: Slow, atmospheric, with gentle movement
- **Why it works**: Slow LFO rate creates ambient sounds that slowly evolve

**Song**: "One More Time" by Daft Punk

- **What to listen for**: The slow, gentle movement in the lead sounds
- **Character**: Slow, gentle, with atmospheric movement
- **Why it works**: Slow LFO rate creates leads that are both atmospheric and musical

### Moderate LFO Rate

**Song**: "Axel F" by Harold Faltermeyer

- **What to listen for**: The rhythmic movement in the lead melody
- **Character**: Rhythmic, with musical movement
- **Why it works**: Moderate LFO rate creates leads that are both rhythmic and musical

**Song**: "Blue Monday" by New Order

- **What to listen for**: The rhythmic movement in the lead sounds
- **Character**: Rhythmic, with musical movement
- **Why it works**: Moderate LFO rate creates leads that are both musical and interesting

### Fast LFO Rate

**Song**: "Jump" by Van Halen

- **What to listen for**: The rapid movement in the lead synth
- **Character**: Rapid, with dramatic movement
- **Why it works**: Fast LFO rate creates leads that are both dramatic and attention-grabbing

**Song**: "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)" by Eurythmics

- **What to listen for**: The rapid movement in the bass line
- **Character**: Rapid, with dramatic movement
- **Why it works**: Fast LFO rate creates bass sounds that are both dramatic and rhythmic

## Advanced LFO Techniques

### LFO Rate Modulation

Use modulation to change the LFO rate over time. This creates evolving, complex sounds.

### LFO Rate Sync

Sync the LFO rate to the tempo of your music. This creates rhythmic movement that works well with the overall groove.

### LFO Rate and Depth Interaction

Combine LFO rate changes with depth changes to create complex, evolving sounds.

## Key Takeaways

- **LFO rate controls movement speed** - slow rate creates gentle movement, fast rate creates dramatic movement
- **Context matters** - choose your LFO rate based on the musical role and desired character
- **Waveform affects the result** - the same LFO rate affects different waveforms differently
- **Depth interaction is important** - LFO rate works together with depth to create the overall movement

The LFO rate is your tool for controlling the speed of movement in your sounds. Understanding how to use it effectively will help you create sounds that are both musical and expressive.
