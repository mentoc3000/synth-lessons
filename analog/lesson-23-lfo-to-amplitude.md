# Lesson 23: LFO to Amplitude

## Creating Tremolo and Volume Effects

LFO to amplitude modulation creates tremolo effects by varying the volume of your sound. This is one of the most classic modulation techniques in synthesis, as it can create everything from subtle volume movement to dramatic tremolo effects. Think of it as adding the tremolo effect that guitarists use with tremolo pedals.

The LFO to amplitude modulation works by adding or subtracting volume from your sound based on the LFO waveform and rate. A slow LFO rate creates gentle volume movement, while a fast LFO rate creates dramatic tremolo effects. The depth control determines how much volume variation occurs.

## Understanding LFO to Amplitude

### LFO Rate and Volume Effects

- **0.1-2 Hz (Slow)**: Creates gentle volume movement, adds subtle expression
- **2-5 Hz (Moderate)**: Creates noticeable tremolo, adds musical character
- **5-10 Hz (Fast)**: Creates dramatic tremolo, attention-grabbing effect
- **10+ Hz (Very Fast)**: Creates extreme tremolo effects, special effects territory

### Depth and Volume Variation

- **Low Depth (10-25%)**: Subtle volume movement, adds gentle expression
- **Moderate Depth (25-50%)**: Noticeable tremolo, adds musical character
- **High Depth (50+%)**: Dramatic tremolo, creates special effects

## Musical Applications

### Gentle Volume Movement

Slow LFO rates with low depth create gentle volume movement that adds subtle expression without being distracting. These are perfect for pads, ambient sounds, and any sound that needs subtle movement.

### Musical Tremolo

Moderate LFO rates with moderate depth create noticeable tremolo that adds musical character. These are great for lead sounds, bass sounds, and any sound that needs musical expression.

### Dramatic Tremolo

Fast LFO rates with high depth create dramatic tremolo effects that grab attention. These are perfect for special effects, lead sounds, and any sound that needs to stand out.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: LFO to Amplitude Exploration

1. Load Analog synthesizer with a sawtooth wave
2. Set the filter to low-pass with cutoff at 50%
3. Enable the LFO and set it to modulate the amplitude
4. Set the LFO rate to 2 Hz and depth to 25%
5. Play a middle C (C4) and notice the volume movement
6. Try different LFO rates and depths
7. Notice how each combination creates different effects

### Exercise 2: LFO Waveform and Amplitude Interaction

1. Set the LFO to modulate amplitude at 2 Hz with 25% depth
2. Try different LFO waveforms (sine, square, triangle, sawtooth)
3. Notice how each waveform creates different volume effects
4. Try different waveforms with different rates and depths

### Exercise 3: Musical Context Test

1. Create a simple chord progression (C-Am-F-G)
2. Try different LFO to amplitude settings for each chord
3. Notice how different settings affect the overall character
4. Try to find the settings that work best for your musical context

### Exercise 4: Filter Interaction

1. Set the LFO to modulate amplitude at 2 Hz with 25% depth
2. Try different filter settings while playing a middle C (C4)
3. Notice how the filter affects the amplitude modulation
4. Try different filter types with different amplitude modulation settings

## Listening Examples

### Gentle Volume Movement

**Song**: "Strobe" by Deadmau5

- **What to listen for**: The gentle volume movement in the pad sounds
- **Character**: Gentle, with subtle volume variation
- **Why it works**: Gentle volume movement creates ambient sounds that slowly evolve

**Song**: "One More Time" by Daft Punk

- **What to listen for**: The gentle volume movement in the lead sounds
- **Character**: Gentle, with subtle volume variation
- **Why it works**: Gentle volume movement creates leads that are both atmospheric and musical

### Musical Tremolo

**Song**: "Axel F" by Harold Faltermeyer

- **What to listen for**: The musical tremolo in the lead melody
- **Character**: Musical, with noticeable volume variation
- **Why it works**: Musical tremolo creates leads that are both expressive and musical

**Song**: "Blue Monday" by New Order

- **What to listen for**: The musical tremolo in the lead sounds
- **Character**: Musical, with noticeable volume variation
- **Why it works**: Musical tremolo creates leads that are both musical and interesting

### Dramatic Tremolo

**Song**: "Jump" by Van Halen

- **What to listen for**: The dramatic tremolo in the lead synth
- **Character**: Dramatic, with extreme volume variation
- **Why it works**: Dramatic tremolo creates leads that are both dramatic and attention-grabbing

**Song**: "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)" by Eurythmics

- **What to listen for**: The dramatic tremolo in the bass line
- **Character**: Dramatic, with extreme volume variation
- **Why it works**: Dramatic tremolo creates bass sounds that are both dramatic and rhythmic

## Advanced LFO to Amplitude Techniques

### LFO Rate Modulation

Use modulation to change the LFO rate over time. This creates evolving tremolo effects.

### LFO Depth Modulation

Use modulation to change the LFO depth over time. This creates evolving volume effects.

### LFO Waveform Modulation

Use modulation to change the LFO waveform over time. This creates complex, evolving volume effects.

## Key Takeaways

- **LFO to amplitude creates tremolo** - different rates and depths create different volume effects
- **Context matters** - choose your LFO settings based on the musical role and desired character
- **Waveform affects the result** - the same rate and depth with different waveforms creates different effects
- **Filter interaction is important** - LFO to amplitude works together with filter settings to create the overall character

LFO to amplitude modulation is your tool for creating tremolo and volume effects in your sounds. Understanding how to use it effectively will help you create sounds that are both musical and expressive.
