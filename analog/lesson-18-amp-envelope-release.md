# Lesson 18: Amp Envelope Release

## Controlling the Ending of Each Note

The amplitude envelope release controls how quickly the volume fades to silence when you release a key. This is crucial for creating the ending character of your sound - whether it ends abruptly or gradually fades away. Think of it as controlling how quickly a sound "disappears" when you release the key.

The release time works in conjunction with the other envelope stages to determine the overall volume contour of your sound. A fast release creates an immediate return to silence, while a slow release creates a gradual, evolving fade that can last for several seconds.

## Understanding Release Time

### Release Time Ranges

- **0ms (Instant)**: The volume immediately drops to silence
- **10-100ms (Fast)**: Quick fade, creates immediate, clean endings
- **100-500ms (Moderate)**: Gradual fade, creates musical, expressive endings
- **500ms-2s (Slow)**: Very gradual fade, creates evolving, ambient endings
- **2s+ (Very Slow)**: Extremely gradual fade, creates dramatic, atmospheric endings

### Release Characteristics

- **Fast Release**: Creates immediate, clean endings with quick fades
- **Moderate Release**: Creates musical, expressive endings with gradual fades
- **Slow Release**: Creates ambient, evolving endings with dramatic fades

## Musical Applications

### Immediate Endings

Fast release times (0-100ms) create sounds that end immediately when you release the key. These are perfect for percussive sounds, bass sounds, and any sound that needs immediate, clean endings.

### Expressive Endings

Moderate release times (100-500ms) create sounds that gradually fade when you release the key. These are great for lead sounds, pads, and any sound that needs musical expression.

### Ambient Endings

Slow release times (500ms+) create sounds that slowly fade and evolve when you release the key. These are perfect for atmospheric sounds, ambient pads, and special effects.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Release Time Exploration

1. Load Analog synthesizer with a sawtooth wave
2. Set the filter to low-pass with cutoff at 75%
3. Set the attack to 100ms, decay to 200ms, and sustain to 50%
4. Start with release at 0ms (instant)
5. Slowly increase the release time while playing a middle C (C4)
6. Notice how the sound becomes more gradual and evolving when you release the key

### Exercise 2: Release and Sustain Interaction

1. Set the release to 200ms (moderate)
2. Try different sustain levels while playing a middle C (C4)
3. Notice how the release time affects the fade from sustain
4. Try different release times with different sustain levels

### Exercise 3: Musical Context Test

1. Create a simple chord progression (C-Am-F-G)
2. Try different release times for each chord
3. Notice how different release times affect the overall character
4. Try to find the release time that works best for your musical context

### Exercise 4: Filter Type Comparison

1. Set the release to 200ms and sustain to 50%
2. Try different filter types (low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, notch)
3. Notice how the release time affects each filter type differently
4. Try different release times with each filter type

## Listening Examples

### Fast Release Sounds

**Song**: "Jump" by Van Halen

- **What to listen for**: The immediate ending of the lead synth when notes are released
- **Character**: Immediate ending, with quick volume fade
- **Why it works**: Fast release creates leads that end cleanly and immediately

**Song**: "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)" by Eurythmics

- **What to listen for**: The immediate ending of the bass line when notes are released
- **Character**: Immediate ending, with quick volume fade
- **Why it works**: Fast release creates bass sounds that end cleanly and establish clear rhythm

### Moderate Release Sounds

**Song**: "Axel F" by Harold Faltermeyer

- **What to listen for**: The gradual ending of the lead melody when notes are released
- **Character**: Gradual ending, with musical volume fade
- **Why it works**: Moderate release creates leads that end expressively and musically

**Song**: "Blue Monday" by New Order

- **What to listen for**: The gradual ending of the lead sounds when notes are released
- **Character**: Gradual ending, with musical volume fade
- **Why it works**: Moderate release creates leads that end both musically and interestingly

### Slow Release Sounds

**Song**: "Strobe" by Deadmau5

- **What to listen for**: The gradual, evolving ending of the pad sounds when notes are released
- **Character**: Gradual ending, with slow volume fade
- **Why it works**: Slow release creates ambient sounds that slowly fade and evolve

**Song**: "One More Time" by Daft Punk

- **What to listen for**: The gradual ending of the lead sounds when notes are released
- **Character**: Gradual ending, with slow volume fade
- **Why it works**: Slow release creates leads that are both atmospheric and musical

## Advanced Release Techniques

### Release Shaping

Use different release curves to create different ending characteristics. Linear release creates steady fade, while exponential release creates accelerating fade.

### Release Modulation

Use modulation to change the release time over time. This creates evolving, complex sounds.

### Release and Filter Interaction

Combine release movement with filter changes to create complex, evolving sounds.

## Key Takeaways

- **Release controls ending speed** - fast release creates immediate endings, slow release creates gradual endings
- **Sustain level affects the result** - higher sustain levels create more dramatic release effects
- **Context matters** - choose your release time based on the musical role and desired character
- **Filter type affects the result** - the same release time affects different filter types differently

The amplitude envelope release is your tool for controlling the ending character of your sound. Understanding how to use it effectively will help you create sounds that are both musical and appropriate for their context.
