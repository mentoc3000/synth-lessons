# Lesson 15: Amp Envelope Attack

## Controlling the Beginning of Each Note

The amplitude envelope attack controls how quickly the volume reaches its peak when you press a key. This is crucial for creating the initial character of your sound - whether it starts immediately with a sharp attack or gradually fades in. Think of it as controlling how quickly a sound "appears" when you press a key.

The attack time works in conjunction with the other envelope stages to create the overall volume contour of your sound. A fast attack creates immediate, punchy sounds, while a slow attack creates gradual, evolving sounds that build over time.

## Understanding Attack Time

### Attack Time Ranges

- **0ms (Instant)**: The volume reaches maximum immediately
- **1-10ms (Very Fast)**: Almost instant, creates sharp, percussive sounds
- **10-50ms (Fast)**: Quick attack, creates punchy, immediate sounds
- **50-200ms (Moderate)**: Gradual attack, creates musical, expressive sounds
- **200ms-1s (Slow)**: Very gradual attack, creates ambient, evolving sounds
- **1s+ (Very Slow)**: Extremely gradual attack, creates dramatic, atmospheric effects

### Attack Characteristics

- **Fast Attack**: Creates immediate, punchy sounds that grab attention
- **Moderate Attack**: Creates musical, expressive sounds with gradual character
- **Slow Attack**: Creates ambient, evolving sounds that build over time

## Musical Applications

### Immediate Sounds

Fast attack times (0-50ms) create sounds that are immediately present and punchy. These are perfect for lead sounds, bass sounds, and any sound that needs to grab attention right away.

### Evolving Sounds

Moderate attack times (50-200ms) create sounds that gradually build their volume. These are great for pads, ambient sounds, and expressive lead sounds.

### Ambient Effects

Slow attack times (200ms+) create sounds that slowly fade in and build. These are perfect for atmospheric sounds, ambient pads, and special effects.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Attack Time Exploration

1. Load Analog synthesizer with a sawtooth wave
2. Set the filter to low-pass with cutoff at 75%
3. Start with attack at 0ms (instant)
4. Slowly increase the attack time while playing a middle C (C4)
5. Notice how the sound becomes more gradual and evolving
6. Try to identify the attack times that sound best for different musical contexts

### Exercise 2: Attack and Filter Interaction

1. Set the attack to 100ms (moderate)
2. Try different filter cutoff positions while playing a middle C (C4)
3. Notice how the attack time affects the overall character
4. Try different attack times with different filter settings

### Exercise 3: Musical Context Test

1. Create a simple chord progression (C-Am-F-G)
2. Try different attack times for each chord
3. Notice how different attack times affect the overall character
4. Try to find the attack time that works best for your musical context

### Exercise 4: Waveform Comparison

1. Set the attack to 100ms
2. Try different waveforms (sawtooth, square, triangle, sine)
3. Notice how the attack time affects each waveform differently
4. Try different attack times with each waveform

## Listening Examples

### Fast Attack Sounds

**Song**: "Jump" by Van Halen

- **What to listen for**: The immediate, punchy character of the lead synth
- **Character**: Immediate, punchy, with instant volume
- **Why it works**: Fast attack creates leads that immediately grab attention

**Song**: "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)" by Eurythmics

- **What to listen for**: The immediate character of the bass line
- **Character**: Immediate, with instant volume
- **Why it works**: Fast attack creates bass sounds that immediately establish the groove

### Moderate Attack Sounds

**Song**: "Axel F" by Harold Faltermeyer

- **What to listen for**: The gradual character development in the lead melody
- **Character**: Gradual, with evolving volume
- **Why it works**: Moderate attack creates leads that are both immediate and expressive

**Song**: "Blue Monday" by New Order

- **What to listen for**: The gradual character development in the lead sounds
- **Character**: Gradual, with evolving volume
- **Why it works**: Moderate attack creates leads that are both musical and interesting

### Slow Attack Sounds

**Song**: "Strobe" by Deadmau5

- **What to listen for**: The gradual, evolving character of the pad sounds
- **Character**: Gradual, with slow volume build-up
- **Why it works**: Slow attack creates ambient sounds that slowly reveal their character

**Song**: "One More Time" by Daft Punk

- **What to listen for**: The gradual character development in the lead sounds
- **Character**: Gradual, with slow volume build-up
- **Why it works**: Slow attack creates leads that are both atmospheric and musical

## Advanced Attack Techniques

### Attack Shaping

Use different attack curves to create different volume characteristics. Linear attack creates steady volume increase, while exponential attack creates accelerating volume increase.

### Attack Modulation

Use modulation to change the attack time over time. This creates evolving, complex sounds.

### Attack and Filter Interaction

Combine attack movement with filter changes to create complex, evolving sounds.

## Key Takeaways

- **Attack controls volume build-up** - fast attack creates immediate sounds, slow attack creates evolving sounds
- **Context matters** - choose your attack time based on the musical role and desired character
- **Waveform affects the result** - the same attack time affects different waveforms differently
- **Filter interaction is important** - attack works together with filter settings to create the overall character

The amplitude envelope attack is your tool for controlling the initial volume character of your sound. Understanding how to use it effectively will help you create sounds that are both immediate and expressive.
