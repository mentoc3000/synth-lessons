# Lesson 10: Filter Envelope Amount

## Adding Movement and Expression

The filter envelope amount is one of the most powerful tools for creating expressive, dynamic sounds. It controls how much the filter envelope affects the filter cutoff, essentially allowing you to create sounds that change character over time. Think of it as a volume control for the filter envelope's effect on the cutoff frequency.

When you press a key, the filter envelope triggers and begins to modulate the filter cutoff. The envelope amount determines how much this modulation affects the sound - from subtle movement to dramatic sweeps that completely change the character of your sound.

## Understanding Filter Envelope Amount

### Envelope Amount Levels

- **0% (No Envelope)**: The filter cutoff stays at its static position
- **25%**: Subtle envelope effect, gentle movement
- **50%**: Moderate envelope effect, noticeable movement
- **75%**: Strong envelope effect, dramatic movement
- **100%**: Maximum envelope effect, extreme movement

### Positive vs. Negative Amount

- **Positive Amount**: The envelope opens the filter (increases cutoff frequency)
- **Negative Amount**: The envelope closes the filter (decreases cutoff frequency)

## Musical Applications

### Subtle Movement

Low envelope amounts (10-30%) create subtle movement that adds interest without being overwhelming. This is great for pads and ambient sounds.

### Expressive Leads

Moderate envelope amounts (40-70%) create expressive lead sounds that change character as you play. This is perfect for creating musical, dynamic sounds.

### Dramatic Effects

High envelope amounts (80-100%) create dramatic effects with sweeping filter changes. This is great for special effects and attention-grabbing sounds.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Envelope Amount Exploration

1. Load Analog synthesizer with a sawtooth wave
2. Set the filter to low-pass with cutoff at 50%
3. Set the filter envelope to moderate attack and decay
4. Start with envelope amount at 0%
5. Slowly increase the envelope amount while playing a middle C (C4)
6. Notice how the sound becomes more dynamic and expressive

### Exercise 2: Positive vs. Negative Amount

1. Set the filter envelope to moderate attack and decay
2. Set the envelope amount to 50%
3. Play a middle C (C4) and notice the filter opening
4. Change the envelope amount to -50%
5. Play the same note and notice the filter closing
6. Notice how the direction affects the character

### Exercise 3: Envelope Shape Testing

1. Set the envelope amount to 50%
2. Try different envelope shapes (fast attack, slow attack, etc.)
3. Notice how different envelope shapes create different effects
4. Try different envelope amounts with each shape

### Exercise 4: Musical Context Test

1. Create a simple chord progression (C-Am-F-G)
2. Try different envelope amounts for each chord
3. Notice how different envelope amounts affect the overall character
4. Try to find the envelope amount that works best for your musical context

## Listening Examples

### Subtle Envelope Movement

**Song**: "Strobe" by Deadmau5

- **What to listen for**: The subtle movement and character changes in the pad sounds
- **Character**: Subtle, with gentle filter movement over time
- **Why it works**: Subtle envelope movement adds interest without being distracting

**Song**: "One More Time" by Daft Punk

- **What to listen for**: The subtle character changes in the lead sounds
- **Character**: Subtle, with gentle filter movement
- **Why it works**: Subtle envelope movement adds character without being overwhelming

### Expressive Envelope Movement

**Song**: "Axel F" by Harold Faltermeyer

- **What to listen for**: The expressive character changes in the lead melody
- **Character**: Expressive, with noticeable filter movement over time
- **Why it works**: Expressive envelope movement creates musical, dynamic leads

**Song**: "Blue Monday" by New Order

- **What to listen for**: The expressive character changes in the lead sounds
- **Character**: Expressive, with noticeable filter movement
- **Why it works**: Expressive envelope movement creates leads that are both musical and interesting

### Dramatic Envelope Movement

**Song**: "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)" by Eurythmics

- **What to listen for**: The dramatic character changes in the bass line
- **Character**: Dramatic, with strong filter movement over time
- **Why it works**: Dramatic envelope movement creates a memorable, attention-grabbing bass sound

**Song**: "Chameleon" by Herbie Hancock

- **What to listen for**: The dramatic character changes in the lead sounds
- **Character**: Dramatic, with strong filter movement
- **Why it works**: Dramatic envelope movement creates expressive, jazz-influenced leads

## Advanced Envelope Techniques

### Envelope Shaping

Use different envelope shapes to create different movement characteristics. Fast attack creates quick changes, while slow attack creates gradual changes.

### Envelope Modulation

Use modulation to change the envelope amount over time. This creates evolving, complex sounds.

### Envelope and Resonance Interaction

Combine envelope movement with resonance to create emphasis effects and special sounds.

## Key Takeaways

- **Envelope amount controls movement** - higher amounts create more dramatic filter changes
- **Direction matters** - positive amounts open the filter, negative amounts close it
- **Context is important** - choose your envelope amount based on the musical role and desired character
- **Envelope shape affects the result** - different envelope shapes create different movement characteristics

The filter envelope amount is your tool for creating movement and expression in your sounds. Understanding how to use it effectively will help you create sounds that are both musical and dynamic.
