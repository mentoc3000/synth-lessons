# Lesson 21: LFO to Pitch

## Creating Vibrato and Pitch Effects

LFO to pitch modulation creates vibrato effects by varying the pitch of your oscillators. This is one of the most expressive modulation techniques in synthesis, as pitch changes are immediately noticeable and can add tremendous musical character to your sounds. Think of it as adding the natural vibrato that singers and instrumentalists use to add expression to their performances.

The LFO to pitch modulation works by adding or subtracting frequency from your oscillators based on the LFO waveform and rate. A slow LFO rate creates gentle vibrato, while a fast LFO rate creates dramatic pitch effects. The depth control determines how much pitch variation occurs.

## Understanding LFO to Pitch

### LFO Rate and Pitch Effects

- **0.1-2 Hz (Slow)**: Creates gentle vibrato, similar to natural vibrato
- **2-5 Hz (Moderate)**: Creates noticeable vibrato, adds musical expression
- **5-10 Hz (Fast)**: Creates dramatic vibrato, attention-grabbing effect
- **10+ Hz (Very Fast)**: Creates extreme pitch effects, special effects territory

### Depth and Pitch Variation

- **Low Depth (5-15 cents)**: Subtle vibrato, adds gentle expression
- **Moderate Depth (15-50 cents)**: Noticeable vibrato, adds musical character
- **High Depth (50+ cents)**: Dramatic vibrato, creates special effects

## Musical Applications

### Gentle Vibrato

Slow LFO rates with low depth create gentle vibrato that adds natural expression without being distracting. These are perfect for lead sounds, pads, and any sound that needs subtle expression.

### Musical Vibrato

Moderate LFO rates with moderate depth create noticeable vibrato that adds musical character. These are great for lead sounds, bass sounds, and any sound that needs musical expression.

### Dramatic Effects

Fast LFO rates with high depth create dramatic pitch effects that grab attention. These are perfect for special effects, lead sounds, and any sound that needs to stand out.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: LFO to Pitch Exploration

1. Load Analog synthesizer with a sawtooth wave
2. Enable the LFO and set it to modulate pitch
3. Set the LFO rate to 2 Hz and depth to 25%
4. Play a middle C (C4) and notice the vibrato effect
5. Try different LFO rates and depths
6. Notice how each combination creates different effects

### Exercise 2: LFO Waveform and Pitch Interaction

1. Set the LFO to modulate pitch at 2 Hz with 25% depth
2. Try different LFO waveforms (sine, square, triangle, sawtooth)
3. Notice how each waveform creates different pitch effects
4. Try different waveforms with different rates and depths

### Exercise 3: Musical Context Test

1. Create a simple chord progression (C-Am-F-G)
2. Try different LFO to pitch settings for each chord
3. Notice how different settings affect the overall character
4. Try to find the settings that work best for your musical context

### Exercise 4: Filter Interaction

1. Set the LFO to modulate pitch at 2 Hz with 25% depth
2. Try different filter settings while playing a middle C (C4)
3. Notice how the filter affects the pitch modulation
4. Try different filter types with different pitch modulation settings

## Listening Examples

### Gentle Vibrato

**Song**: "Strobe" by Deadmau5

- **What to listen for**: The gentle vibrato in the pad sounds
- **Character**: Gentle, with subtle pitch variation
- **Why it works**: Gentle vibrato creates ambient sounds that slowly evolve

**Song**: "One More Time" by Daft Punk

- **What to listen for**: The gentle vibrato in the lead sounds
- **Character**: Gentle, with subtle pitch variation
- **Why it works**: Gentle vibrato creates leads that are both atmospheric and musical

### Musical Vibrato

**Song**: "Axel F" by Harold Faltermeyer

- **What to listen for**: The musical vibrato in the lead melody
- **Character**: Musical, with noticeable pitch variation
- **Why it works**: Musical vibrato creates leads that are both expressive and musical

**Song**: "Blue Monday" by New Order

- **What to listen for**: The musical vibrato in the lead sounds
- **Character**: Musical, with noticeable pitch variation
- **Why it works**: Musical vibrato creates leads that are both musical and interesting

### Dramatic Pitch Effects

**Song**: "Jump" by Van Halen

- **What to listen for**: The dramatic pitch effects in the lead synth
- **Character**: Dramatic, with extreme pitch variation
- **Why it works**: Dramatic pitch effects create leads that are both dramatic and attention-grabbing

**Song**: "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)" by Eurythmics

- **What to listen for**: The dramatic pitch effects in the bass line
- **Character**: Dramatic, with extreme pitch variation
- **Why it works**: Dramatic pitch effects create bass sounds that are both dramatic and rhythmic

## Advanced LFO to Pitch Techniques

### LFO Rate Modulation

Use modulation to change the LFO rate over time. This creates evolving vibrato effects.

### LFO Depth Modulation

Use modulation to change the LFO depth over time. This creates evolving pitch effects.

### LFO Waveform Modulation

Use modulation to change the LFO waveform over time. This creates complex, evolving pitch effects.

## Key Takeaways

- **LFO to pitch creates vibrato** - different rates and depths create different vibrato effects
- **Context matters** - choose your LFO settings based on the musical role and desired character
- **Waveform affects the result** - the same rate and depth with different waveforms creates different effects
- **Filter interaction is important** - LFO to pitch works together with filter settings to create the overall character

LFO to pitch modulation is your tool for creating vibrato and pitch effects in your sounds. Understanding how to use it effectively will help you create sounds that are both musical and expressive.
