# Lesson 8: Filter Cutoff

## Controlling Brightness and Character

The filter cutoff is the most important control for shaping your sound's character. It determines the frequency at which the filter begins to affect the sound, essentially controlling how bright or dark your sound appears. Think of it as a brightness control that can dramatically change the mood and character of your sound.

The cutoff frequency works differently depending on the filter type:

- **Low-pass**: Frequencies above the cutoff are attenuated
- **High-pass**: Frequencies below the cutoff are attenuated  
- **Band-pass**: Only frequencies around the cutoff pass through
- **Notch**: Frequencies around the cutoff are attenuated

## Understanding Cutoff Frequency

The cutoff frequency is measured in Hertz (Hz) and typically ranges from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz (the full range of human hearing). However, in most synthesizers, the cutoff is controlled with a knob that goes from 0 to 100%, making it easier to work with musically.

### Low-Pass Cutoff Positions

- **100% (Fully Open)**: No filtering, full brightness
- **75%**: Slight filtering, still bright but controlled
- **50%**: Moderate filtering, balanced brightness
- **25%**: Heavy filtering, dark and mellow
- **0% (Fully Closed)**: Maximum filtering, very dark

### High-Pass Cutoff Positions

- **0% (Fully Closed)**: No filtering, full frequency range
- **25%**: Slight filtering, removes some low frequencies
- **50%**: Moderate filtering, removes low-mid frequencies
- **75%**: Heavy filtering, removes most low frequencies
- **100% (Fully Open)**: Maximum filtering, only high frequencies

## Musical Applications

### Bright Sounds

Higher cutoff frequencies create brighter, more present sounds that cut through the mix. These are great for lead sounds, bright pads, and sounds that need to be heard clearly.

### Dark Sounds

Lower cutoff frequencies create darker, mellower sounds that sit back in the mix. These are great for bass sounds, dark pads, and sounds that provide atmosphere.

### Dynamic Filtering

Using modulation to change the cutoff over time creates movement and expression. This is one of the most powerful techniques in synthesis.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Cutoff Range Exploration

1. Load Analog synthesizer with a sawtooth wave
2. Set the filter to low-pass
3. Start with the cutoff at 100% (fully open)
4. Slowly lower the cutoff while playing a middle C (C4)
5. Notice how the sound becomes progressively darker
6. Try to identify the cutoff positions that sound best

### Exercise 2: Filter Type Comparison

1. Set the cutoff to 50%
2. Try each filter type (low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, notch)
3. Notice how the same cutoff position affects each filter type differently
4. Try different cutoff positions with each filter type

### Exercise 3: Musical Context Test

1. Create a simple chord progression (C-Am-F-G)
2. Try different cutoff positions for each chord
3. Notice how different cutoff positions affect the overall character
4. Try to find the cutoff position that works best for your musical context

### Exercise 4: Frequency Range Testing

1. Set the filter to low-pass with cutoff at 50%
2. Play different octaves (C2, C4, C6)
3. Notice how the filter affects different frequency ranges
4. Adjust the cutoff to find the optimal position for each octave

## Listening Examples

### Bright Cutoff Settings

**Song**: "Jump" by Van Halen

- **What to listen for**: The bright, cutting character of the lead synth
- **Character**: Bright, cutting, with high-frequency content
- **Why it works**: Bright cutoff settings create leads that cut through the mix with authority

**Song**: "Axel F" by Harold Faltermeyer

- **What to listen for**: The bright, focused character of the lead melody
- **Character**: Bright, focused, with controlled high frequencies
- **Why it works**: Bright cutoff settings create focused, memorable leads

### Dark Cutoff Settings

**Song**: "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)" by Eurythmics

- **What to listen for**: The warm, mellow character of the bass line
- **Character**: Warm, mellow, with reduced high-frequency content
- **Why it works**: Dark cutoff settings create warm, musical bass sounds

**Song**: "Blue Monday" by New Order

- **What to listen for**: The warm, analog character of the lead sounds
- **Character**: Warm, analog, with controlled brightness
- **Why it works**: Dark cutoff settings give leads a warm, musical character

### Dynamic Cutoff Changes

**Song**: "Strobe" by Deadmau5

- **What to listen for**: The changing brightness of the pad sounds
- **Character**: Dynamic, with changing brightness over time
- **Why it works**: Dynamic cutoff changes create movement and interest

**Song**: "One More Time" by Daft Punk

- **What to listen for**: The changing character of the lead sounds
- **Character**: Dynamic, with changing brightness over time
- **Why it works**: Dynamic cutoff changes create excitement and energy

## Advanced Cutoff Techniques

### Filter Sweeping

Use modulation to sweep the cutoff frequency over time. This creates movement and expression in your sounds.

### Key Tracking

Use key tracking to make the cutoff frequency follow the keyboard. This ensures consistent brightness across all notes.

### Resonance Interaction

Combine cutoff changes with resonance to create emphasis effects and special sounds.

## Key Takeaways

- **Cutoff controls brightness** - higher cutoff creates brighter sounds, lower cutoff creates darker sounds
- **Filter type affects the result** - the same cutoff position affects different filter types differently
- **Context matters** - choose your cutoff position based on the musical role and desired character
- **Dynamic changes add expression** - using modulation to change cutoff over time creates movement and interest

The filter cutoff is your primary tool for controlling the brightness and character of your sound. Understanding how to use it effectively will help you create sounds that are both musical and appropriate for their context.
