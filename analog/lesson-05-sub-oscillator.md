# Lesson 5: Sub Oscillator

## Adding Low-End Power

The sub oscillator is a specialized oscillator that typically plays one or two octaves below your main oscillators. It's designed to add deep, powerful low-end content to your sound without the complexity of the main oscillators. Think of it as your bass foundation - it provides the low-end power that makes your sound feel full and present.

The sub oscillator is usually a simple waveform (often a square wave or sine wave) that tracks your keyboard but plays at a lower octave. This creates a rich, full sound that's perfect for bass lines, lead sounds that need low-end presence, and any sound that needs to feel powerful and grounded.

## Understanding Octave Relationships

The sub oscillator typically offers several octave options:

- **-1 Octave**: Plays one octave below the main oscillators
- **-2 Octaves**: Plays two octaves below the main oscillators
- **-3 Octaves**: Plays three octaves below (very deep, sub-bass territory)

Each octave down doubles the frequency, so a -1 octave sub oscillator playing a C4 (middle C) will actually play a C3, and a -2 octave will play a C2.

## Sub Oscillator Characteristics

### Square Wave Sub

A square wave sub oscillator provides a rich, harmonic sub-bass with some mid-range presence. This is great for bass lines that need both low-end power and some definition.

### Sine Wave Sub

A sine wave sub oscillator provides pure, clean low-end without any harmonic content. This is perfect for sub-bass that needs to be clean and not interfere with other elements.

### Triangle Wave Sub

A triangle wave sub oscillator provides a smooth, mellow sub-bass with subtle harmonic content. This is great for bass sounds that need to be musical and not too aggressive.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Sub Oscillator Exploration

1. Load Analog synthesizer with sawtooth waves on both main oscillators
2. Turn on the sub oscillator and set it to -1 octave
3. Play a middle C (C4) and listen to the added low-end content
4. Try different octave settings (-1, -2, -3)
5. Notice how each octave affects the overall sound

### Exercise 2: Sub Oscillator Level Testing

1. Set the sub oscillator to -1 octave
2. Start with the sub level at 0%
3. Slowly bring up the sub level while playing a middle C (C4)
4. Notice how the sub adds low-end power and fullness
5. Try to find the optimal level for your sound

### Exercise 3: Waveform Comparison

1. Set the sub oscillator to -1 octave
2. Try different waveforms (square, sine, triangle)
3. Notice how each waveform affects the character
4. Try different octave settings with each waveform

### Exercise 4: Musical Context Test

1. Create a simple bass line using only the sub oscillator
2. Add the main oscillators and notice how they work together
3. Try different sub levels to find the right balance
4. Notice how the sub affects the overall character of the sound

## Listening Examples

### Square Wave Sub Oscillator

**Song**: "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)" by Eurythmics

- **What to listen for**: The deep, powerful bass line that repeats throughout
- **Character**: Deep, rich, with harmonic content
- **Why it works**: Square wave sub provides both low-end power and mid-range presence

**Song**: "Blue Monday" by New Order

- **What to listen for**: The deep, punchy bass line that drives the song
- **Character**: Deep, punchy, with harmonic content
- **Why it works**: Square wave sub provides both bass foundation and definition

### Sine Wave Sub Oscillator

**Song**: "One More Time" by Daft Punk

- **What to listen for**: The deep, clean bass sounds that underpin the track
- **Character**: Deep, clean, without harmonic content
- **Why it works**: Sine wave sub provides clean low-end foundation without interference

**Song**: "Strobe" by Deadmau5

- **What to listen for**: The deep, clean bass sounds in the intro
- **Character**: Deep, clean, without harmonic content
- **Why it works**: Sine wave sub provides clean foundation for the complex lead sounds

### Triangle Wave Sub Oscillator

**Song**: "Chameleon" by Herbie Hancock

- **What to listen for**: The smooth, mellow bass sounds
- **Character**: Deep, smooth, with subtle harmonic content
- **Why it works**: Triangle wave sub provides musical bass foundation without being too aggressive

**Song**: "I Feel Love" by Donna Summer

- **What to listen for**: The smooth, pulsing bass sounds
- **Character**: Deep, smooth, with subtle harmonic content
- **Why it works**: Triangle wave sub provides smooth foundation for the disco beat

## Advanced Sub Oscillator Techniques

### Frequency Separation

Use the sub oscillator to provide low-end content while the main oscillators handle mid-range and high frequencies. This creates a clear frequency separation that works well in dense arrangements.

### Dynamic Sub

Use modulation to change the sub oscillator level over time. This can create interesting movement in your bass sounds.

### Contextual Sub

Adjust your sub oscillator level based on the musical context. Dense arrangements might need less sub, while sparse arrangements can handle more sub content.

## Key Takeaways

- **Sub oscillator adds low-end power** - it provides the bass foundation that makes your sound feel full
- **Octave selection matters** - different octaves create different low-end characteristics
- **Waveform choice affects character** - square provides harmonics, sine provides purity, triangle provides smoothness
- **Level balance is crucial** - too much sub can muddy the mix, too little can make the sound thin

The sub oscillator is your tool for adding low-end power and fullness to your sounds. Understanding how to use it effectively will help you create sounds that feel powerful and present in your mix.
