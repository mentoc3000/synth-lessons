# Lesson 11: Filter Envelope Attack

## Controlling the Opening Speed

The filter envelope attack controls how quickly the filter opens when you press a key. This is crucial for creating the initial character of your sound - whether it starts bright and immediate or gradually opens to reveal its full character. Think of it as controlling how quickly a curtain opens to reveal the stage.

The attack time works in conjunction with the envelope amount to determine the initial filter movement. A fast attack with high envelope amount creates an immediate, bright sound, while a slow attack creates a gradual, evolving sound that builds over time.

## Understanding Attack Time

### Attack Time Ranges

- **0ms (Instant)**: The filter opens immediately when you press a key
- **10-50ms (Fast)**: Quick opening, creates immediate brightness
- **100-500ms (Moderate)**: Gradual opening, creates evolving character
- **500ms-2s (Slow)**: Very gradual opening, creates dramatic build-up
- **2s+ (Very Slow)**: Extremely gradual opening, creates ambient effects

### Attack Characteristics

- **Fast Attack**: Creates immediate, punchy sounds that grab attention
- **Moderate Attack**: Creates musical, expressive sounds with gradual character
- **Slow Attack**: Creates ambient, evolving sounds that build over time

## Musical Applications

### Immediate Sounds

Fast attack times (0-50ms) create sounds that are immediately present and bright. These are perfect for lead sounds, bass sounds, and any sound that needs to grab attention right away.

### Evolving Sounds

Moderate attack times (100-500ms) create sounds that gradually reveal their character. These are great for pads, ambient sounds, and expressive lead sounds.

### Ambient Effects

Slow attack times (500ms+) create sounds that slowly build and evolve. These are perfect for atmospheric sounds, ambient pads, and special effects.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Attack Time Exploration

1. Load Analog synthesizer with a sawtooth wave
2. Set the filter to low-pass with cutoff at 50%
3. Set the filter envelope amount to 50%
4. Start with attack at 0ms (instant)
5. Slowly increase the attack time while playing a middle C (C4)
6. Notice how the sound becomes more gradual and evolving

### Exercise 2: Attack and Envelope Amount Interaction

1. Set the attack to 200ms (moderate)
2. Start with envelope amount at 25%
3. Slowly increase the envelope amount while playing a middle C (C4)
4. Notice how the attack time affects the envelope movement
5. Try different attack times with different envelope amounts

### Exercise 3: Musical Context Test

1. Create a simple chord progression (C-Am-F-G)
2. Try different attack times for each chord
3. Notice how different attack times affect the overall character
4. Try to find the attack time that works best for your musical context

### Exercise 4: Filter Type Comparison

1. Set the attack to 200ms and envelope amount to 50%
2. Try each filter type (low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, notch)
3. Notice how the attack time affects each filter type differently
4. Try different attack times with each filter type

## Listening Examples

### Fast Attack Sounds

**Song**: "Jump" by Van Halen

- **What to listen for**: The immediate, bright character of the lead synth
- **Character**: Immediate, bright, with instant filter opening
- **Why it works**: Fast attack creates leads that immediately grab attention

**Song**: "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)" by Eurythmics

- **What to listen for**: The immediate character of the bass line
- **Character**: Immediate, with instant filter opening
- **Why it works**: Fast attack creates bass sounds that immediately establish the groove

### Moderate Attack Sounds

**Song**: "Axel F" by Harold Faltermeyer

- **What to listen for**: The gradual character development in the lead melody
- **Character**: Gradual, with evolving filter opening
- **Why it works**: Moderate attack creates leads that are both immediate and expressive

**Song**: "Blue Monday" by New Order

- **What to listen for**: The gradual character development in the lead sounds
- **Character**: Gradual, with evolving filter opening
- **Why it works**: Moderate attack creates leads that are both musical and interesting

### Slow Attack Sounds

**Song**: "Strobe" by Deadmau5

- **What to listen for**: The gradual, evolving character of the pad sounds
- **Character**: Gradual, with slow filter opening
- **Why it works**: Slow attack creates ambient sounds that slowly reveal their character

**Song**: "One More Time" by Daft Punk

- **What to listen for**: The gradual character development in the lead sounds
- **Character**: Gradual, with slow filter opening
- **Why it works**: Slow attack creates leads that are both atmospheric and musical

## Advanced Attack Techniques

### Attack Shaping

Use different attack curves to create different opening characteristics. Linear attack creates steady opening, while exponential attack creates accelerating opening.

### Attack Modulation

Use modulation to change the attack time over time. This creates evolving, complex sounds.

### Attack and Resonance Interaction

Combine attack movement with resonance to create emphasis effects and special sounds.

## Key Takeaways

- **Attack controls opening speed** - fast attack creates immediate sounds, slow attack creates evolving sounds
- **Envelope amount affects the result** - higher amounts create more dramatic attack effects
- **Context matters** - choose your attack time based on the musical role and desired character
- **Filter type affects the result** - the same attack time affects different filter types differently

The filter envelope attack is your tool for controlling the initial character of your sound. Understanding how to use it effectively will help you create sounds that are both immediate and expressive.
