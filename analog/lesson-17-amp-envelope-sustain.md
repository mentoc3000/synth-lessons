# Lesson 17: Amp Envelope Sustain

## Setting the Steady State Volume

The amplitude envelope sustain controls the steady-state volume level while you hold down a key. This is the volume the sound settles to after the attack and decay phases, and it remains at this level as long as you hold the key. Think of it as setting the "resting" volume of your sound during the note's duration.

The sustain level works in conjunction with the other envelope stages to determine the overall volume contour of your sound. A high sustain level creates a loud, present sound, while a low sustain level creates a quieter, more subtle sound.

## Understanding Sustain Level

### Sustain Level Ranges

- **0% (Minimum)**: The volume drops to silence
- **25%**: Low sustain, creates quiet, subtle sounds
- **50%**: Moderate sustain, creates balanced sounds
- **75%**: High sustain, creates loud, present sounds
- **100% (Maximum)**: The volume stays at maximum

### Sustain Characteristics

- **Low Sustain**: Creates quiet, subtle sounds with low volume
- **Moderate Sustain**: Creates balanced sounds with moderate volume
- **High Sustain**: Creates loud, present sounds with high volume

## Musical Applications

### Subtle Sounds

Low sustain levels (0-25%) create quiet, subtle sounds that sit back in the mix. These are perfect for atmospheric sounds, background pads, and sounds that provide texture.

### Balanced Sounds

Moderate sustain levels (25-75%) create balanced sounds that work well in most musical contexts. These are great for lead sounds, pads, and general-purpose sounds.

### Present Sounds

High sustain levels (75-100%) create loud, present sounds that cut through the mix. These are perfect for lead sounds, bass sounds, and sounds that need to be heard clearly.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Sustain Level Exploration

1. Load Analog synthesizer with a sawtooth wave
2. Set the filter to low-pass with cutoff at 75%
3. Set the attack to 100ms and decay to 200ms
4. Start with sustain at 0%
5. Slowly increase the sustain level while playing a middle C (C4)
6. Notice how the sound becomes louder and more present

### Exercise 2: Sustain and Envelope Interaction

1. Set the sustain to 50% (moderate)
2. Try different attack and decay times while playing a middle C (C4)
3. Notice how the sustain level affects the overall volume contour
4. Try different sustain levels with different attack and decay times

### Exercise 3: Musical Context Test

1. Create a simple chord progression (C-Am-F-G)
2. Try different sustain levels for each chord
3. Notice how different sustain levels affect the overall character
4. Try to find the sustain level that works best for your musical context

### Exercise 4: Filter Type Comparison

1. Set the sustain to 50% and envelope to moderate settings
2. Try different filter types (low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, notch)
3. Notice how the sustain level affects each filter type differently
4. Try different sustain levels with each filter type

## Listening Examples

### Low Sustain Sounds

**Song**: "Strobe" by Deadmau5

- **What to listen for**: The subtle, quiet character of the pad sounds
- **Character**: Subtle, quiet, with low volume
- **Why it works**: Low sustain creates atmospheric sounds that don't overwhelm the mix

**Song**: "One More Time" by Daft Punk

- **What to listen for**: The subtle character of the background sounds
- **Character**: Subtle, quiet, with low volume
- **Why it works**: Low sustain creates background elements that provide texture

### Moderate Sustain Sounds

**Song**: "Axel F" by Harold Faltermeyer

- **What to listen for**: The balanced character of the lead melody
- **Character**: Balanced, with moderate volume
- **Why it works**: Moderate sustain creates leads that are both present and musical

**Song**: "Blue Monday" by New Order

- **What to listen for**: The balanced character of the lead sounds
- **Character**: Balanced, with moderate volume
- **Why it works**: Moderate sustain creates leads that are both musical and interesting

### High Sustain Sounds

**Song**: "Jump" by Van Halen

- **What to listen for**: The loud, present character of the lead synth
- **Character**: Loud, present, with high volume
- **Why it works**: High sustain creates leads that cut through the mix with authority

**Song**: "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)" by Eurythmics

- **What to listen for**: The loud, present character of the bass line
- **Character**: Loud, present, with high volume
- **Why it works**: High sustain creates bass sounds that establish the groove

## Advanced Sustain Techniques

### Sustain Shaping

Use different sustain levels to create different volume characteristics. Low sustain creates subtle sounds, while high sustain creates present sounds.

### Sustain Modulation

Use modulation to change the sustain level over time. This creates evolving, complex sounds.

### Sustain and Filter Interaction

Combine sustain level with filter settings to create complex, evolving sounds.

## Key Takeaways

- **Sustain controls steady state volume** - higher sustain creates louder sounds, lower sustain creates quieter sounds
- **Context matters** - choose your sustain level based on the musical role and desired character
- **Filter type affects the result** - the same sustain level affects different filter types differently
- **Envelope interaction is important** - sustain works together with attack and decay to create the overall volume contour

The amplitude envelope sustain is your tool for controlling the steady-state volume of your sound. Understanding how to use it effectively will help you create sounds that are both musical and appropriate for their context.
