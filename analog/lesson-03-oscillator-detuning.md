# Lesson 3: Oscillator Detuning

## Creating Depth and Character

Oscillator 2 is where the magic happens in analog synthesis. While Oscillator 1 provides your primary pitch, Oscillator 2 adds depth, character, and complexity to your sound. The key to understanding Oscillator 2 is learning how to detune it relative to Oscillator 1.

Detuning means setting Oscillator 2 to a slightly different frequency than Oscillator 1. This creates a phenomenon called "beating" - when two frequencies are close but not identical, they interfere with each other, creating a pulsing effect. The closer the frequencies, the slower the beat; the further apart, the faster the beat.

## Musical Intervals and Detuning

The most musical detuning occurs when Oscillator 2 is set to specific intervals above Oscillator 1. Common intervals include:

- **Unison (0 cents)**: Both oscillators at the same pitch - creates a thicker, more powerful sound
- **Minor Second (100 cents)**: Creates a dissonant, edgy sound
- **Major Second (200 cents)**: Creates a slightly dissonant, interesting sound
- **Minor Third (300 cents)**: Creates a minor chord-like sound
- **Major Third (400 cents)**: Creates a major chord-like sound
- **Perfect Fourth (500 cents)**: Creates a stable, consonant sound
- **Perfect Fifth (700 cents)**: Creates a very stable, consonant sound
- **Octave (1200 cents)**: Creates a rich, full sound with harmonic content

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Detuning Exploration

1. Load Analog synthesizer with sawtooth waves on both oscillators
2. Set Oscillator 1 to track the keyboard
3. Set Oscillator 2 to a fixed frequency (not tracking the keyboard)
4. Play a middle C (C4) and slowly detune Oscillator 2
5. Notice how the beating changes as you move the frequency
6. Try to find the "sweet spot" where the beating sounds musical

### Exercise 2: Interval Testing

1. Set both oscillators to sawtooth waves
2. Set Oscillator 1 to track the keyboard
3. Set Oscillator 2 to specific intervals above Oscillator 1
4. Try each interval (unison, minor second, major second, etc.)
5. Notice how each interval creates a different character
6. Try playing chords with different intervals to hear how they work harmonically

### Exercise 3: Musical Context Test

1. Create a simple chord progression (C-Am-F-G)
2. Try different detuning amounts for each chord
3. Notice how some detuning sounds good on some chords but not others
4. Try to find a detuning that works well for the entire progression

## Listening Examples

### Unison Detuning

**Song**: "Jump" by Van Halen

- **What to listen for**: The thick, powerful lead sound that opens the song
- **Character**: Rich, full, with a distinctive analog character
- **Why it works**: Unison detuning creates a thicker, more powerful sound that cuts through the mix

**Song**: "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)" by Eurythmics

- **What to listen for**: The main bass line that repeats throughout
- **Character**: Deep, powerful, with a distinctive analog character
- **Why it works**: Unison detuning provides both low-end power and mid-range presence

### Minor Second Detuning

**Song**: "Axel F" by Harold Faltermeyer

- **What to listen for**: The edgy, dissonant character of the lead melody
- **Character**: Slightly dissonant, with a distinctive edge
- **Why it works**: Minor second detuning creates tension and interest without being too harsh

**Song**: "Blue Monday" by New Order

- **What to listen for**: The slightly dissonant character of the lead sounds
- **Character**: Edgy, interesting, with a distinctive character
- **Why it works**: Minor second detuning adds character without being too dissonant

### Major Third Detuning

**Song**: "Chameleon" by Herbie Hancock

- **What to listen for**: The chord-like character of the lead sounds
- **Character**: Rich, harmonic, with a distinctive chord-like quality
- **Why it works**: Major third detuning creates a chord-like sound that's both melodic and harmonic

**Song**: "I Feel Love" by Donna Summer

- **What to listen for**: The rich, harmonic character of the bass sounds
- **Character**: Deep, rich, with a distinctive harmonic content
- **Why it works**: Major third detuning provides both bass foundation and harmonic richness

### Perfect Fifth Detuning

**Song**: "One More Time" by Daft Punk

- **What to listen for**: The rich, full character of the bass sounds
- **Character**: Deep, rich, with a distinctive harmonic content
- **Why it works**: Perfect fifth detuning creates a very stable, consonant sound that works well for bass

**Song**: "Strobe" by Deadmau5

- **What to listen for**: The rich, harmonic character of the pad sounds
- **Character**: Rich, full, with a distinctive harmonic content
- **Why it works**: Perfect fifth detuning provides both harmonic richness and stability

## Advanced Detuning Techniques

### Chorus Effect

When you detune Oscillator 2 by a small amount (5-20 cents), you create a chorus effect. This makes the sound appear wider and more spacious, as if multiple instruments are playing the same part.

### Unison Effect

When you detune Oscillator 2 by a very small amount (1-5 cents), you create a unison effect. This makes the sound appear thicker and more powerful, as if multiple instruments are playing in perfect unison.

### Beat Frequency

The beat frequency is the difference between the two oscillator frequencies. For example, if Oscillator 1 is at 440 Hz and Oscillator 2 is at 441 Hz, the beat frequency is 1 Hz - one beat per second.

## Key Takeaways

- **Detuning creates character** - small detuning amounts create chorus effects, larger amounts create intervals
- **Musical intervals work best** - detuning to specific intervals creates more musical results
- **Beating adds interest** - the interference between oscillators creates movement and character
- **Context matters** - different detuning amounts work better in different musical contexts

Oscillator 2 is your tool for adding depth and character to your sounds. Understanding how to detune it effectively will help you create sounds that are both musical and interesting.
