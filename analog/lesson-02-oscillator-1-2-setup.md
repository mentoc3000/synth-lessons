# Lesson 2: Oscillator 1 & 2 Setup

## Understanding the Two-Oscillator System

Ableton's Analog synthesizer features a two-oscillator system that forms the foundation of your sound. Oscillator 1 is your primary oscillator - it tracks the keyboard and provides the main pitch. Oscillator 2 can either track the keyboard (playing the same note) or be set to a fixed frequency, creating interesting detuning effects.

The key to understanding this system is recognizing that both oscillators work together to create a single, more complex sound. When both oscillators are active, they combine their waveforms to create a richer, more interesting timbre than either oscillator alone.

## Oscillator Configuration

Oscillator 1 is typically set to track the keyboard, meaning it follows the notes you play. Oscillator 2 can be configured in several ways:

- **Keyboard Tracking**: Both oscillators play the same note, creating a thicker sound
- **Fixed Frequency**: Oscillator 2 stays at a constant frequency while Oscillator 1 tracks the keyboard
- **Octave Offset**: Oscillator 2 plays one or more octaves above or below Oscillator 1

The relationship between these two oscillators is what gives analog synthesizers their characteristic sound. Understanding how to configure them effectively is crucial for sound design.

## Waveform Selection

Each oscillator can be set to different waveforms (sawtooth, square, triangle, sine). The combination of waveforms between the two oscillators creates different timbral characteristics:

- **Same Waveform**: Creates a thicker, more powerful version of the single waveform
- **Different Waveforms**: Creates complex timbres with unique harmonic content
- **Sine + Sawtooth**: Combines pure tone with harmonic richness
- **Square + Triangle**: Creates a balanced, musical sound

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Single Oscillator Setup

1. Load Analog synthesizer
2. Turn off Oscillator 2 (set its level to 0)
3. Set Oscillator 1 to sawtooth wave
4. Play a middle C (C4) and listen to the character
5. Try different waveforms on Oscillator 1
6. Notice how each waveform has a different character

### Exercise 2: Two Oscillator Setup

1. Turn on both oscillators
2. Set both to sawtooth waves
3. Play a middle C (C4) and listen to the thicker sound
4. Try different waveform combinations
5. Notice how the combination creates new timbres

### Exercise 3: Oscillator Balance

1. Set both oscillators to sawtooth waves
2. Start with Oscillator 1 at full level and Oscillator 2 at 0
3. Slowly bring up Oscillator 2 level
4. Notice how the sound changes as you add the second oscillator
5. Try different balance ratios (50/50, 70/30, 30/70)

## Listening Examples

### Single Oscillator Sounds

**Song**: "Strobe" by Deadmau5

- **What to listen for**: The clean, simple lead sounds in the intro
- **Character**: Pure, focused, with a single waveform character
- **Why it works**: Single oscillator sounds are clean and don't compete with other elements

**Song**: "One More Time" by Daft Punk

- **What to listen for**: The simple bass sounds that underpin the track
- **Character**: Deep, focused, with a single waveform character
- **Why it works**: Single oscillator bass provides clean low-end foundation

### Two Oscillator Sounds

**Song**: "Jump" by Van Halen

- **What to listen for**: The thick, powerful lead sound that opens the song
- **Character**: Rich, full, with multiple oscillator character
- **Why it works**: Two oscillators create a thicker, more powerful sound that cuts through the mix

**Song**: "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)" by Eurythmics

- **What to listen for**: The rich, complex bass line that repeats throughout
- **Character**: Deep, rich, with multiple oscillator character
- **Why it works**: Two oscillators provide both low-end power and harmonic richness

### Waveform Combinations

**Song**: "Axel F" by Harold Faltermeyer

- **What to listen for**: The distinctive lead melody that repeats throughout
- **Character**: Unique, with a combination of waveform characteristics
- **Why it works**: Different waveforms on each oscillator create unique timbres

**Song**: "Blue Monday" by New Order

- **What to listen for**: The complex lead sounds in the intro and throughout
- **Character**: Rich, complex, with multiple waveform characteristics
- **Why it works**: Waveform combinations create interesting, musical timbres

## Key Takeaways

- **Two oscillators create richer sounds** - combining oscillators adds harmonic content and thickness
- **Waveform selection matters** - different combinations create different timbres
- **Balance is crucial** - the relative levels of each oscillator affect the final sound
- **Configuration affects character** - how you set up the oscillators determines the sound's character

Understanding how to configure and balance your two oscillators is the foundation of analog synthesis. This knowledge will help you create sounds that are both musical and interesting.
