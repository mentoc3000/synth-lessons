# Lesson 16: Amp Envelope Decay

## Controlling the Transition to Sustain

The amplitude envelope decay controls how quickly the volume transitions from its peak (after the attack) to its sustain level. This is crucial for creating the character of your sound during the initial phase of each note. Think of it as controlling how quickly the initial volume settles to the steady-state level.

The decay time works in conjunction with the attack and sustain levels to create the initial character of your sound. A fast decay creates a quick transition to the sustain level, while a slow decay creates a gradual, evolving transition that can last for several seconds.

## Understanding Decay Time

### Decay Time Ranges

- **0ms (Instant)**: The volume immediately jumps to the sustain level
- **10-100ms (Fast)**: Quick transition, creates punchy, immediate sounds
- **100-500ms (Moderate)**: Gradual transition, creates musical, expressive sounds
- **500ms-2s (Slow)**: Very gradual transition, creates evolving, ambient sounds
- **2s+ (Very Slow)**: Extremely gradual transition, creates dramatic, atmospheric effects

### Decay Characteristics

- **Fast Decay**: Creates punchy, immediate sounds with quick transitions
- **Moderate Decay**: Creates musical, expressive sounds with gradual transitions
- **Slow Decay**: Creates ambient, evolving sounds with dramatic transitions

## Musical Applications

### Punchy Sounds

Fast decay times (0-100ms) create sounds that quickly settle to their sustain level. These are perfect for percussive sounds, bass sounds, and any sound that needs immediate character.

### Expressive Sounds

Moderate decay times (100-500ms) create sounds that gradually transition to their sustain level. These are great for lead sounds, pads, and any sound that needs musical expression.

### Ambient Effects

Slow decay times (500ms+) create sounds that slowly evolve and transition. These are perfect for atmospheric sounds, ambient pads, and special effects.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Decay Time Exploration

1. Load Analog synthesizer with a sawtooth wave
2. Set the filter to low-pass with cutoff at 75%
3. Set the attack to 100ms and sustain to 50%
4. Start with decay at 0ms (instant)
5. Slowly increase the decay time while playing a middle C (C4)
6. Notice how the sound becomes more gradual and evolving

### Exercise 2: Decay and Sustain Interaction

1. Set the decay to 200ms (moderate)
2. Start with sustain at 25%
3. Slowly increase the sustain level while playing a middle C (C4)
4. Notice how the decay time affects the transition to sustain
5. Try different decay times with different sustain levels

### Exercise 3: Musical Context Test

1. Create a simple chord progression (C-Am-F-G)
2. Try different decay times for each chord
3. Notice how different decay times affect the overall character
4. Try to find the decay time that works best for your musical context

### Exercise 4: Filter Type Comparison

1. Set the decay to 200ms and sustain to 50%
2. Try different filter types (low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, notch)
3. Notice how the decay time affects each filter type differently
4. Try different decay times with each filter type

## Listening Examples

### Fast Decay Sounds

**Song**: "Jump" by Van Halen

- **What to listen for**: The quick transition to sustain in the lead synth
- **Character**: Quick transition, with immediate settling to sustain level
- **Why it works**: Fast decay creates leads that quickly establish their character

**Song**: "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)" by Eurythmics

- **What to listen for**: The quick transition to sustain in the bass line
- **Character**: Quick transition, with immediate settling to sustain level
- **Why it works**: Fast decay creates bass sounds that quickly establish their groove

### Moderate Decay Sounds

**Song**: "Axel F" by Harold Faltermeyer

- **What to listen for**: The gradual transition to sustain in the lead melody
- **Character**: Gradual transition, with musical settling to sustain level
- **Why it works**: Moderate decay creates leads that are both immediate and expressive

**Song**: "Blue Monday" by New Order

- **What to listen for**: The gradual transition to sustain in the lead sounds
- **Character**: Gradual transition, with musical settling to sustain level
- **Why it works**: Moderate decay creates leads that are both musical and interesting

### Slow Decay Sounds

**Song**: "Strobe" by Deadmau5

- **What to listen for**: The gradual, evolving transition to sustain in the pad sounds
- **Character**: Gradual transition, with slow settling to sustain level
- **Why it works**: Slow decay creates ambient sounds that slowly evolve

**Song**: "One More Time" by Daft Punk

- **What to listen for**: The gradual transition to sustain in the lead sounds
- **Character**: Gradual transition, with slow settling to sustain level
- **Why it works**: Slow decay creates leads that are both atmospheric and musical

## Advanced Decay Techniques

### Decay Shaping

Use different decay curves to create different transition characteristics. Linear decay creates steady transition, while exponential decay creates accelerating transition.

### Decay Modulation

Use modulation to change the decay time over time. This creates evolving, complex sounds.

### Decay and Filter Interaction

Combine decay movement with filter changes to create complex, evolving sounds.

## Key Takeaways

- **Decay controls transition speed** - fast decay creates quick transitions, slow decay creates gradual transitions
- **Sustain level affects the result** - higher sustain levels create more dramatic decay effects
- **Context matters** - choose your decay time based on the musical role and desired character
- **Filter type affects the result** - the same decay time affects different filter types differently

The amplitude envelope decay is your tool for controlling the transition character of your sound. Understanding how to use it effectively will help you create sounds that are both immediate and expressive.
