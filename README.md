# Synthesizer Lessons with Ableton Live

A comprehensive, physics-based approach to learning audio synthesis using Ableton Live's built-in synthesizers. Each synthesizer is broken down into small, focused lessons that build your understanding step by step.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of music theory (notes, scales, intervals)
- Understanding of wave properties (frequency, amplitude, phase)
- Familiarity with harmonics and overtones
- Ableton Live with the built-in synthesizer plugins

## Learning Philosophy

This course breaks down synthesis into small, digestible pieces. Each lesson focuses on one specific control, allowing you to deeply understand its function before moving to the next concept. We'll connect each control to the underlying physics and mathematics you already know.

## Available Synthesizers

### üéõÔ∏è [Analog Synthesizer](./analog/README.md)

**32 lessons** - Learn subtractive synthesis with Ableton's Analog plugin

- Oscillators, filters, envelopes, and modulation
- Perfect for understanding classic synthesizer concepts
- Physics-based approach to sound design

### üéπ [Operator Synthesizer](./operator/README.md)

**Coming Soon** - Explore frequency modulation (FM) synthesis

- Complex waveforms and modulation matrices
- Advanced synthesis techniques
- Mathematical approach to sound creation

### üåä [Wavetable Synthesizer](./wavetable/README.md)

**Coming Soon** - Master modern wavetable synthesis

- Waveform morphing and scanning
- Modern synthesis techniques
- Creative sound design possibilities

## Getting Started

1. **Choose Your Synthesizer** - Start with Analog for foundational concepts
2. **Follow the Lessons Sequentially** - Each lesson builds on previous knowledge
3. **Practice Actively** - Experiment with each control before moving on
4. **Take Notes** - Document your discoveries and favorite settings
5. **Create Patches** - Build your own sounds using the concepts from each lesson

## File Organization

- `analog/` - Complete lesson series for Analog synthesizer
- `operator/` - Future lessons for Operator synthesizer  
- `wavetable/` - Future lessons for Wavetable synthesizer

## How Each Lesson Works

Each lesson file contains:

- **Physics Background** - The science behind the concept
- **Step-by-Step Instructions** - Clear, actionable steps
- **Listening Exercises** - Train your ears to hear the effects
- **Practical Applications** - Real-world uses for each technique
- **Common Mistakes** - What to avoid and how to troubleshoot
